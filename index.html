			<p>Klopp said Liverpool "would love" to play their home games at Anfield but feels there is no advantage when crowds are absent, as shown by results since the Bundesliga resumed.

"We will not have the help from the crowd but no team will have that so where is the advantage? Whoever we play it is the same situation which is why I'm not too worried about it," said Klopp.

"We have tried to simulate the situation by training in the stadium and getting used to it."I can promise that if it happens, there will be a parade as well. Whenever. Who cares! We only need one day when everybody is able to come and then we will do that."</p>
